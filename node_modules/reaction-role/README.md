**ReactionRole** is a module that allows you to create Discord reaction role easily! Now with database support!

This module is compatible with all node.js discord wrappers (like discord.js, eris, discord.js-commando etc.)

You also don't need to write any bot code if you want! You can also use this module alone. You just need a Discord Bot Token!
